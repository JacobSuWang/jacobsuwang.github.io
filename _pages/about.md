I am a Senior Research Engineer at [Balyasny Asset Management](https://www.bamfunds.com/), working with [Peter Anderson](https://panderson.me/) and [Charlie Flanagan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cflanagan1984/).

Previously, I was a Senior Research Engineer at Google DeepMind, specializing in multimodality, and most recently focusing on the application and evaluation of large generative models in the form of LLMs and VLMs.

In my earlier career, I worked on vision-language navigation and text-to-image generation/editing at Google Research, and also collaborated with Robotics on vision-language related projects.

Before joining Google I completed my PhD in Computation Linguistics at [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Greg Durett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/) and [Katrin Erk](https://www.katrinerk.com/). My interests and perspectives in computational linguistcs are influenced from a ``pure linguistics'' angle by the teachings of [Matthew Dryer](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~dryer/), my mentor when I worked on my M.A. in Linguistics at [University at Buffalo](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/linguistics.html), as well as from a formal / logical angle by [Hans Kamp](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Kamp/) in his teachings at UT Austin.
